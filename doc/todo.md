# The improvement ideas
* Mail server multi-threading (imap & pop)
* Be sure that the duty job is ongoing (room monitoring after to have raise the alert, phone validation (dtmf))
* Escalation, two types:
* * during the NBH call if the duty guy is not ok
* * during the troubleshooting if the duty guy need more support (can be technical or management in case of cell crisis for example)
